# CNNdatascraper
***Does not work with money.cnn.com, www.cnn.com/videos. 
Puts important information to ".txt" file format from CNN. Not sure if it works with OS X(Apple).

If using Chrome browser:

If you want to manually get every CNN page:
1. Make a bookmark (Name it whatever you want)
2. Copy and paste the code in "ManualCNNStrip" to the bookmarks "URL:" tab. 
3. Let the page load, meaning when the circle stops and the prefab(CNN tiny image) shows 
4. Click the bookmark on the CNN page of choice(As long as it isnt part of the *** section on top of this README document)
5. Viola, the page is downloaded to a ".txt" file and can be accessed easily (Only gets the "important" text)

If you want to Semi-Automatically gain tabs:
1. Get extension named "Tampermonkey"
2. Once installed, navigate to "OpenUserjs.org"
3. On the right side of the page, there should be a search bar.
4. Search "CNN Strip"
5. Should be the only one, but click the UserScript with the author "JustAnOrdinaryCoder"
6. On the almost top section of the page, click "Install"
7. A page should open up for TamperMonkey, and click "Install" again there.
8. The code will automatically trigger when entering a CNN page.  

If you want an even faster way to download the files:
1. Do everything in "If you want to Semi-Automatically gain tabs" 
2. Get another extention called "Linkclump"
3. Now you can "Right-click and drag" to get all the links within a box.
4. This will "net" a greater amount of tabs, instead of "Control Left-Clicking" everything.
